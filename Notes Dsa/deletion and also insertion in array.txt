//3. make a loop to insert on from decreasing war from last index to 0
//4. i = size - 1 coz we need index and index start from 0 to 4 and lenght is 5 so size is -1
//5. i >= index coz we want it to stop travesering till this element as soon and
//we are shifting every element like arr[i+1]= a[i]
//6. in the last when all are shifted and made an space for the index put value in the 
//arr[index] = element
